# AIVA Chat Application - Database Integration Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to resolve database connectivity issues and ensure proper data retrieval from the real Azure SQL Database instead of mock data.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Problems
**Problem**: The application was falling back to mock database instead of connecting to the real Azure SQL Database due to firewall restrictions and incorrect connection logic.

**Solution**:
- Modified `database.ts` and `azure.ts` to only use mock database when explicitly enabled (`MOCK_DATABASE=true`)
- Enhanced error handling to provide specific guidance for firewall issues
- Fixed connection logic to properly authenticate with Azure SQL Database

**Files Modified**:
- `server/src/config/database.ts`
- `server/src/services/azure.ts`

### 2. Message Actions Not Retrieving from Database
**Problem**: Liked messages, disliked messages, and bookmarks were not being retrieved from the MessageActions table in the SQL database.

**Solution**:
- Verified and fixed the API routes in `messageActions.ts` and `bookmarks.ts`
- Ensured proper SQL joins to retrieve message content and chat titles
- Confirmed data is retrieved from MessageActions table joined with Messages and Chats tables

**Files Modified**:
- `server/src/routes/messageActions.ts`
- `server/src/routes/bookmarks.ts`

### 3. Chat History Not Retrieving from Database
**Problem**: Chat history was not being retrieved from the Chats table in the SQL database.

**Solution**:
- Verified and fixed the API routes in `history.ts`
- Ensured proper SQL queries to retrieve chat history with last message content
- Confirmed data is retrieved from Chats table

**Files Modified**:
- `server/src/routes/history.ts`

### 4. New Chat Creation Issues
**Problem**: New chats were not being properly created with user ID and workspace ID in the database.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the Dashboard component to properly pass workspace IDs when creating new chats
- Modified `chat.ts` to handle user creation conflicts and avoid UNIQUE KEY constraint violations
- Ensured new chats are inserted into the chats table in the database

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- `server/src/routes/chat.ts`

## Technical Approaches

### Database Connection Approach
1. **Connection Logic**: Modified the database connection logic to prioritize real database connections
2. **Error Handling**: Added specific error messages for firewall issues with step-by-step resolution guidance
3. **Mock Database**: Only enabled mock database when explicitly configured with `MOCK_DATABASE=true`

### Message Actions Approach
1. **SQL Joins**: Used proper INNER JOINs to connect MessageActions, Messages, and Chats tables
2. **Data Mapping**: Mapped database records to frontend-friendly format with proper titles and descriptions
3. **API Endpoints**: Created separate endpoints for liked, disliked, and bookmarked messages

### Chat History Approach
1. **Efficient Queries**: Used TOP and ORDER BY clauses for efficient retrieval of recent chats
2. **Last Message Retrieval**: Implemented subqueries to fetch the last message for each chat
3. **Pagination Support**: Added pagination support for better performance with large datasets

### New Chat Creation Approach
1. **Workspace Integration**: Properly integrated workspace IDs in chat creation
2. **User Conflict Resolution**: Implemented checks to avoid UNIQUE KEY constraint violations
3. **Default Workspace Creation**: Added logic to create default workspaces when none exist

## Verification Steps

### API Endpoint Testing
1. **Liked Messages**: `GET /api/message-actions/liked`
2. **Disliked Messages**: `GET /api/message-actions/disliked`
3. **Bookmarks**: `GET /api/bookmarks`
4. **Chat History**: `GET /api/history`

All endpoints were tested and confirmed to work with real database data.

## Environment Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured in `.env`:
```
SQL_SERVER=aivaserver.database.windows.net
SQL_DATABASE=aivadb
SQL_USERNAME=aivadbadmin
SQL_PASSWORD=******
SQL_ENCRYPT=true
SQL_TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE=false
MOCK_DATABASE=false
```

## Firewall Configuration

If you encounter database connection errors, follow these steps:
1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your SQL Server (aivaserver)
3. Go to "Firewalls and virtual networks"
4. Add your current IP address to the firewall rules
5. Save the changes and wait a few minutes for the changes to take effect

## Testing Results

All API endpoints have been verified to work correctly with the real database:
- ✅ Liked messages retrieved successfully from MessageActions table
- ✅ Disliked messages retrieved successfully from MessageActions table
- ✅ Bookmarks retrieved successfully from MessageActions table
- ✅ Chat history retrieved successfully from Chats table
- ✅ New chats created successfully in the database with proper user and workspace associations

## Files Modified Summary

1. `server/src/config/database.ts` - Database connection logic
2. `server/src/services/azure.ts` - Azure service initialization
3. `server/src/routes/messageActions.ts` - Liked/disliked messages endpoints
4. `server/src/routes/bookmarks.ts` - Bookmarks endpoints
5. `server/src/routes/history.ts` - Chat history endpoints
6. `server/src/routes/chat.ts` - Chat creation and message handling
7. `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Frontend chat creation and message actions

## Conclusion

The AIVA chat application now properly retrieves all data from the real Azure SQL Database instead of mock data. All message actions (liked messages, disliked messages, bookmarks) and chat history features are working correctly with proper database integration.
